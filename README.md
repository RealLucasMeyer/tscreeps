# My Screeps AI in Typescript

This is my [Screeps](http://www.screeps.com) code written in TypeScript. I should have started with TypeScript, since a lot of the errors that one will get with JavaScript are due to variable type mismatches.

## Starter

This code was based on [Screeps TypeScript Starter](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter/). They have instructions on how to set up your environment to use TypeScript with Screeps.

## Typings

The type definitions for Screeps come from [typed-screeps](https://github.com/screepers/typed-screeps). It is set up as a module.
